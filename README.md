Lenticuprint (0.0.1)
=====================================

by [Mark Nelson](http://www.markonthenet.com/)

This is a small winforms app I threw together to help me with lenticular printing.

What it is for:
---------------
Lenticular printing takes multiple images and interlaces them together. When placed behind a lenticular lense it will become either 3D or animated depending on what you are printing.

What it does:
-------------
Allows you to load any number of images, set an LPI (lines per inch) for the lenticulation, then writes the result to a printer.
